**DESCRIPTION** :
This Java program is a menu-driven file handler that allows users to interact with a text file by reading its contents, writing new content (overwriting the existing data), appending additional text to the file, or modifying a specific line. It starts by asking the user for a filename and then presents a menu with options to perform the desired file operation. The program continuously prompts the user until they choose to exit. Each action is handled using appropriate file operations such as BufferedReader for reading and BufferedWriter for writing, ensuring efficient file handling. If a user selects the modify option, the program reads the file, updates the specified line, and then rewrites the content. It ensures smooth interaction and proper handling of file operations, making it a simple yet effective tool for managing text files.
